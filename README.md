# Simple-9-bits-Processor
A Simple 9 bits Processor
a simple processor that contains a number of nine-bit registers, a multiplexer, an adder/subtractor unit and a control unit (finite state machine).
The input of 9-bit data to the system is via the DIN input. This data can be loaded via a large multiplexer of different registers. The size of the inputs and the size of the output of the multiplexer is 9 bits. The multiplexer also allows data to be transferred from one register to register to the other. The output of the multiplexer can be called bus because it allows to transfer data from one location to another.
This processor is implemented on a DE1 SOC
